Kanban2 Design Architecture

A second implementation of Kanban

The first implementation, the ill fated 'kanbanfordevelopers.com', was written in jQuery, Ruby on Rails, and MySQL backend. 

This implementation uses Angular JS, Node JS, and SQLite3.


Object Information:
Users
Boards
Lanes
Tasks

Users:
    id
    name
    email
    
Boards:
    id
    user_id
    name
    
Lanes:
    id
    board_id
    name
    
Tasks:
    id
    board_id
    lane_id
    title
    description
    <numerous other fields>
    
Thus, a user has multiple boards, boards have multiple (swim) lanes, and lanes have multiple tasks.
