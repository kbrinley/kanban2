Release Plan

While I'm not sure if this will ever reach a state of 'Release ready', here is a rough plan to get started for the Sprint 0 + 2 sprints.

Sprint 0:
    Feb. 1st through Feb. 28th

    Goal: Provide the barebones architecture framework to further explore Git, Node JS, Angular, and other technologies.
    
    Stories:
        --0.1: Spike to research creation of a SQLite db from within NodeJS
            AC: Create a database with a table, version, which I'll insert a record for each sprint
            NOTE: app.js now has functions which creates a table. We can add to this function to build out the db structure if the tables do not exist.
        --0.2: Integrate NodeJS, Bootstrap, and Angular JS
            As a developer, I want Bootstrap and Angular JS integrated in my layout.jade file so that it is available for coding.
            NOTE: in index.jade, both Bootstrap and Angular JS are integrated as a demonstration, but both are available to all pages which extend layout.jade
        0.3: Spike to learn Jade
            As a developer, I want to learn Jade so that I am more familiar with it when I need to use it in later stories.
            AC: Be able to create a more complex index page than the one provided
        --0.4: Spike to learn Node.Js and other requisite technologies
            As a developer, I want to learn NodeJS and Express (and any other backend technologies) so that when I am more familiar with it when I need to use it.
        --0.5: Spike to re-learn Angular JS
            As a developer, I want to learn Angular JS so that I am more familiar with it when I need to use it in later stories.
        0.6: Spike to research other needed architecture items needed for the project.
            As a developer, I want to research my architecture to determine if there are gaps that require another tool to integrate
                Unit tests with Node JS & Angular?
            
Sprint 1:
    March 1st through March 14th
