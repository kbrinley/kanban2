Release Plan

While I'm not sure if this will ever reach a state of 'Release ready', here is a rough plan to get started for the Sprint 0 + 2 sprints.

Sprint 0:
    Feb. 1st through Feb. 28th

    Goal: Provide the barebones architecture framework to further explore Git, Node JS, Angular, and other technologies.
    
    Stories:
        1.1: Spike to research creation of a SQLite db from within NodeJS
            AC: Create a database with a table, version, which I'll insert a record for each sprint
        1.2: Integrate NodeJS, Bootstrap, and Angular JS
            As a developer, I want Bootstrap and Angular JS integrated in my layout.jade file so that it is available for coding.
        1.3: Spike to learn Jade
            As a developer, I want to learn Jade so that I am more familiar with it when I need to use it in later stories.
            AC: Be able to create a more complex index page than the one provided
        1.4: Spike to learn Node.Js and other requisite technologies
            As a developer, I want to learn NodeJS and Express (and any other backend technologies) so that when I am more familiar with it when I need to use it.
        1.5: Spike to re-learn Angular JS
            As a developer, I want to learn Angular JS so that I am more familiar with it when I need to use it in later stories.
        1.6: Spike to research other needed architecture items needed for the project.
            As a developer, I want to research my architecture to determine if there are gaps that require another tool to integrate
